    <h3 class="f">And Then There Were None</h3>
<p class="b">One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none." When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts.He'd cooked Seton's goose all right!' The idiom 'cooked his goose' means that someone is in trouble. Literally, the phrase means to heat up poultry, but the expression has come to mean something else.Themes of And Then There Were None include guilt and justice. Each guest brought to the island is accused of an unprovable murder. As the body count rises, guests grapple with their personal feelings of guilt in different ways. The confession of Justice Wargrave explains the theme of justice.</p>

The confession of Justice Wargrave explains the theme of justice.Justice Wargrave wrote a confession stating that he was the murderer of the guests on the island. He satisfied his imaginative nature by arranging the killings according to a nursery rhyme. Wargrave chose victims who had gotten away with murder to satisfy his sense of justice; he killed them to fulfill his bloodlust.</p>
