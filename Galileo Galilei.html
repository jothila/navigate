He discovered that the Moon has hills.Galileo was a natural philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who made fundamental contributions to the sciences of motion, astronomy, and strength of materials and to the development of the scientific method.

    <p class="b">I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him. All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them. Mathematics is the key and door to the sciences.Galileo Galilei was an Italian scientist who formulated the basic law of falling bodies, which he verified by careful measurements. He constructed a telescope with which he studied lunar craters, and discovered four moons revolving around Jupiter and espoused the Copernican cause.Introduction and Background. From the seventeenth century onward, Galileo has been seen by many as the “hero” of modern science. He is renowned for his discoveries: he was the first to report telescopic observations of the mountains on the moon, the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the rings of Saturn.</p>
