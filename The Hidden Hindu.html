   <h1 class="f">The Hidden Hindu</h1>
   <p class="b">The Hidden Hindu is a mixture of Mythology and science fiction. This book may seem like a fictional story but it gives us a view into many mythological facts and even historical facts such as about Subash Chandra Bose.The hidden hindu is based on the concept of the seven immortals in Hinduism who are believed to be alive even after the end of the epoch (yug) they were born in. I have long been fascinated by the idea of the last avatar of Vishnu- Kalki who is prophesied to descend on the earth at the end of Kali yuga.The writing style of Mr Akshat Gupta is very engaging and it is such that even a non-fiction reader will love this book. It is a good fun book to read to give you mind a tour of imagination and history. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first book and will be buying the second one for sure.</p>

<p class="b">For Hindus the universe was created by Brahma, the creator who made the universe out of himself. After Brahma created the world, it is the power of Vishnu which preserves the world and human beings. As part of the cycle of birth, life and death it is Shiva who will ultimately destroy the universe.The Hidden Hindu is the product of sheer dedication and research for continuous two years. He is working on the second and third parts of this fiction trilogy which is a blend of Hindu mythology and Indian history.The three-part movie is based on the best-selling English novel, The Hidden Hindu authored by Akshat Gupta. The untitled movie is under the pre-production phase and the production house will announce the cast, and other details of the ambitious project at a later date.</p>
