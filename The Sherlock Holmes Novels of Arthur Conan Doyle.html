    <h1 class="f">The Sherlock Holmes Novels of Arthur Conan Doyle</h1>
    <p class="b">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. Published in 1892, the stories involve the peculiar exploits of the sharp-witted detective Sherlock Holmes, whose fierce energy and acute observation and reasoning skills enable him to solve the strangest of crimes.Traditionally, the canon of Sherlock Holmes consists of the 56 short stories and four novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In this context, the term "canon" is an attempt to distinguish between Doyle's original works and subsequent works by other authors using the same characters.</p>

<p class="b">As Conan Doyle wrote to Joseph Bell, "Holmes is as inhuman as a Babbage's Calculating Machine and just about as likely to fall in love." Holmes says of himself that he is "not a whole-souled admirer of womankind", and that he finds "the motives of women .Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character created by the Scottish writer Arthur Conan Doyle. However, Conan Doyle did model Holmes's methods and mannerisms on those of Dr. Joseph Bell, who had been his professor at the University of Edinburgh Medical School.Sherlock Holmes is the ever-observant, world-renowned detective of 221b Baker Street. For all his assumed genius and intuition he is virtually omniscient in these stories, and Holmes becomes more accessible in the context of his constant posturing and pretension. Holmes lets down his guard and admits of a fragile ego.</p>
