    <p class="b">Chance favors the prepared mind. Wine is the most healthful and most hygienic of beverages. A bottle of wine contains more philosophy than all the books in the world.Louis Pasteur is best known for inventing the process that bears his name, pasteurization. Pasteurization kills microbes and prevents spoilage in beer, milk, and other goods. In his work with silkworms, Pasteur developed practices that are still used today for preventing disease in silkworm eggs.Pasteur became a pioneer in the development of vaccinations, i.e., the introduction into the body of a mild (attenuated) form of a pathogen to produce immunity from the more harmful strain of the disease. He developed vaccinations for anthrax and fowl cholera, but his rabies vaccine was the most famous.</p>

Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) is revered by his successors in the life sciences as well as by the general public. In fact, his name provided the basis for a household word—pasteurized.Louis Pasteur was unique as he helped people who were suffering in some special way from diseases. He helped brewers, cow keepers and breeders of silk worms, all of whom were trying to carry on important industries in France. Pasteur was proud to help his country in this manner.</p>
